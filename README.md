# Intelligent Traffic Light System for Emission Reduction

## Overview
This project aims to implement an Intelligent Traffic Light System utilizing Machine Learning techniques to optimize traffic flow and reduce CO2 emissions. By predicting optimal traffic light timings, we aim to minimize wait times for vehicles, thereby reducing congestion and emissions.

## Features
- **Machine Learning Model**: Utilizes linear regression to predict optimal traffic light timings based on traffic data.
- **Data Analysis**: Comprehensive analysis of traffic data to derive insights for effective traffic management strategies.
- **Web Interface**: A user-friendly web interface developed using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML for data visualization.
- **Firebase Integration**: Project infrastructure includes integration with Firebase database for real-time data storage and retrieval.
- **GitHub Visualization**: Visualized GitHub data to demonstrate collaboration and contributions to the project.

## Project Structure
- `machine_learning_model.py`: Contains the code for the machine learning model implementation.
- `data_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for performing data analysis and deriving insights.
- `web_interface/`: Directory containing files for the web interface development.
- `firebase_integration.py`: Code for integrating Firebase database into the project.
- `github_visualization.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for visualizing GitHub collaboration data.
- `traffic_light_image.jpg`: Image file for the project illustration.
